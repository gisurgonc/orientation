# Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

## Chemoradiation

Nigro protocol [@nigro1826]

### Restaging after chemoRT

Based on the results of the ACT-II study, it may be appropriate to follow patients who have not achieved a complete clinical response with persistent anal cancer up to 6 months following completion of radiation therapy and chemotherapy as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease during this period of follow-up. Persistent disease may continue to regress even at 26 weeks from the start of treatment.[@james516] James RD, et al. Lancet Oncol 2013;14:516-524
