# Rectal Cancer Staging

## MRI staging

Rectal cancer is preferentially evaluated with MRI. At Atrium, this is ordered as "MRI Pelvis without Contrast Rectal Protocol"

Key findings

- Circumferential resection margin
- Extra mesorectal vascular invasion
- Mesorectal lymph nodes
- Extra-mesorectal lymph nodes

MRI has supplanted endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) as the study of choice for staging rectal cancer.

## EUS

Endoscopic ultrasound has now been replaced by MRI for initial staging, in part due to intraoperater variability
