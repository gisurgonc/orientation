# Colorectal Cases - Hill/Squires

**Pre-op holding**

ADULT SURG Colorectal ERAS MPP Hill This is what has all of the main ERAS components. Tylenol, gabapentin, Decadron, Alvimopan and heparin are all given in pre-op holding

ADULT STANDING Antimicrobial colorectal In general, I will give Ancef to patients with almost all patients with allergies to PCN. They have to remember the “severe” reaction. If it is a severe reaction, please use the second line ABX listed in the power plan.

Type and Screen are not typically needed for colectomy. They will have an antibody screen from office. If antibodies present, then d/w attending

**Intra-op**

Positioning: I typically like to position myself.

Right sided=supine; Left sided=lithotomy; All laparoscopic colon cases will have their arms tucked with a chest tape strap.

NG/OG tubes Not needed. I will have anesthesia place if we have gastric distension. We give a multiple PO meds prior.

Review anesthesia fluid management during time out. 2L max volume, urine output not an accurate indicator.
