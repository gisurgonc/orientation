<div id="Intro" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1 number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<div id="absences" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2 number="1.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Absences</h2>
<p>Please notify Dr Hill, Dr Salo and Dr Squires before the beginning of the rotation if you will be away during the month. This includes vacations, meetings, interview trips, and other absences.</p>
</div>
<div id="communication" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2 number="1.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Communication</h2>
<p>Please use Halo for messaging service attendings rather than SMS. Please check our status prior to messaging nights and weekends. If we are listed as unavailable, please contact another Surgical Oncology attending or the CMC “GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc” attending on call.</p>
</div>
<div id="inpatients" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2 number="1.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Inpatients</h2>
<p>By in large, service attendings all wish to know about major changes in the status of our own patients. For most of the issues for which you would need to contact an attending at night, we would prefer that you HALO us directly rather than the on-call person. This desire is 24/7 (unless Halo says that attending is “off”).</p>
</div>
<div id="er-admits" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2 number="1.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> ER admits</h2>
<p>We would ask to use a combination of communication for ER admissions. All patients must be discussed with an attending.
• If the patient is stable, does not need surgery, etc. then we would ask you to contact the attending on call for GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc. Please contact them according to that attending’s preferences (page, text, call, etc).
• If the patient is unstable, may need surgery or will have ongoing and/or have intensive management needs the following day please HALO that patient’s surgical oncology attending directly. The difference is that this patient is sick - we would like to know about all of our sick patients. If the Surg Onc attending is listed as “off” within Halo then please contact the GI MIS Blue Surgery Attending Colorectal Onc on-call attending.</p>
</div>
<div id="medical-records" class="section level2" number="1.5">
<h2 number="1.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Medical Records</h2>
<p>Completing medical records in a timely fashion is critical for patient safety, billing, and compliance. Timeliness also demonstrates an understanding of how the world of surgery for which residents are being prepared functions.</p>
</div>
<div id="operative-logs" class="section level2" number="1.6">
<h2 number="1.6"><span class="header-section-number">1.6</span> Operative Logs</h2>
<p>Completion of operative logs is critical for board certification of the individual resident but also has implications for the appropriate assignment of residents to surgical rotations AND impacts the ability of the residency to maintain accreditation and recruit resident candidates. Residents who find it difficult to find time to maintain operative logs may find themselves excused from the operating room to complete them. Residents are expected to complete operative logs within two weeks of the end of the rotation.</p>
</div>
<div id="case-assignment" class="section level2" number="1.7">
<h2 number="1.7"><span class="header-section-number">1.7</span> Case Assignment</h2>
<p>The senior resident will be expected to make case assignments for junior residents and students. It in not necessary split the month by attending - splitting by case is acceptable as well.  We also expect that  both residents know all the patients rather than just for one attending. This helps with nursing questions, etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="clinic" class="section level2" number="1.8">
<h2 number="1.8"><span class="header-section-number">1.8</span> Clinic</h2>
<p>Clinic is an important part of a surgeon’s education, where decisions are made regarding diagnostic workup, patient evaluation, and treatment planning. The expectation is that all residents on the service attend clinic once per week.</p>
</div>
<div id="work-hours" class="section level2" number="1.9">
<h2 number="1.9"><span class="header-section-number">1.9</span> Work Hours</h2>
<p>If the service workload jeopardizes your ability to abide by the work hour restrictions, you must notify an attending so that arrangements can be made. The service attendings are committed to abiding by work hour restrictions.</p>
<!--chapter:end:index.Rmd-->
</div>
</div>
<div id="cmc-inpatient" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1 number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> CMC Inpatient</h1>
<p>Colorectal Surgery (Davis/Kasten) and GI Surgical Oncology (Hill/Salo/Squires) will cover Pineville and CMC. For efficiency, the services at each hospital will merge for patient care. Each patient will continue to have an attending surgeon, but rounding and inpatient care will be provided by the service.</p>
<p>In general Dr Kasten will round on his own patients at CMC. Dr Davis will round on his own patients if he is at CMC.</p>
<div id="admissions" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2 number="2.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Admissions</h2>
<p>Admitting Provider: “CMC GI SURGICAL ONCOLOGY”</p>
<p>List Attending Surgeon in addition</p>
<p>Patient List is CMC GI Surgical Oncology</p>
</div>
<div id="rounds" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2 number="2.2"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Rounds</h2>
<p>Attending rounds for both services (CR and SurgOnc) start at 6am in STICU or 11T. Dr Salo rounds M-Tu and Drs Squires and Hill round W/Th/F alternate weeks</p>
</div>
<div id="resident-halo-teams" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2 number="2.3"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Resident Halo teams:</h2>
<p>CMC AH Colorectal Surgery 1st Call
CMC LCI GI Surgical Oncology 1st Call
Residents will be assigned to Halo teams by schedule. It is critical that you notify service attendings before the start of the month to adjust the resident Halo schedule. Each “shift” is 5:50am to 6pm. At 6pm the resident Halo Teams will be forwarded to the night team.</p>
<p>Please append a text block to the bottom of each progress note specifying the Halo Team for that patient to facilitate communication from nursing.</p>
</div>

# Diagnosis

The diagnosis of esophageal cancer is generally made at upper endscopy. Several findings at EGD are important in the subsequent workup and treatment:

 - Location of the tumor from the incisors
 - Length of the tumor
 - Location of the gastroesophageal junction relative to the tumor
 - Presence and extent of Barrett's changes
 - Presence and extent of invasion of tumor into the gastric cardia, particularly along the lesser curvature side. This is best seen with a retroflexed view

<div id="progress-notes" class="section level1" number="5">
<h1 number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Progress Notes</h1>
<p>Progress notes should include a comprehensive summary of pertinent information for the patient’s medical care.</p>
<p>A running summary of events is recorded in the Shared Hospital Course under Inpatient Workflow</p>
<p>Each day, this section is carried from note to note so that each progress note contains the cancer history and the daily events.</p>
<p>The Progress Note then includes the date and a one-line summary of the operation performed and any intraoperative complications or events which impact the post-operative care.</p>
<p>Each day, an additional line is added to the Shared Hospital Course which summarizes events for that day. This makes it possible to see within each Progress Note the pertinent events for the hospitalization. These events would include extubation, re-intubation, positive cultures, dates lines are inserted or removed, dates of removal of NG tubes and drains, and transfer to ward or re-admission to ICU. This chronology assists in treatment decisions (“how old is the IJ line” or “when did we start antibiotics?” or “when is the planned antibiotic stop date?”) but also makes the discharge summary much easier to prepare.</p>
<p>Assessment/Plan
The medical problems currently being managed are addressed in the assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>Please add an addendum at the BOTTOM of each progress note which includes a means for contacting the team:</p>
<p>Please message “CMC LCI GI Surgical 1st Call” via Halo 24/7. Messages are automatically forwarded to the General Surgery Resident on Call evenings and weekends.</p>
<!--chapter:end:04-notes.Rmd-->
<p>#Signout</p>
<p><strong>Evening Signout</strong></p>
<p>The Handoff Tool should be completed for all inpatients, and the responsible attending designated. This tool is critical for the safe care of patients by the nigh team. If there are studies which are pending at the time of signout (CT scan, follow-up Hb), it is critical that a plan be in place for whom to notify with an abnormal or critical study. In general, Drs Hill and Salo are always available until 10pm. Attending notification plans (service attending vs covering attending) for unstable patients should be negotiated before nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>Weekend Signout</strong></p>
<p>The chief resident is responsible for making certain that the weekend rounding resident is familiar with the patients, their problems, and the plan of care. A signout email should be prepared Friday afternoon and forwarded to the service attendings by 6pm for their review. This signout can then be edited with the attendings’ notes and forwarded to the weekend rounding attending.</p>

<p><strong>Discharge Prescriptions</strong></p>
<p>Prescriptions should be ideally be prepared the day prior to anticipated discharge and left in the patient’s ‘soft chart.’ According to North Carolina STOP guidelines, opioid prescriptions for postoperative patients should be for no more than a 7 day supply.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Appointments</strong></p>
<p>If followup appointments in additional to surgical followup are needed, these should be designated on the discharge orders. Particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary Care Physician</li>
<li>Cardiologist (if new cardiac medicines)</li>
<li>Co-surgeons (Urology, Thoracic Surgery, GYN)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discharge Summary</strong></p>
<p>The discharge summary documents important events and complications in the postoperative course and serves to inform the referring physician and primary physician about these events, but also serves as a blueprint for post-discharge treatment planning.

<h3 number="7.0.1"><span class="header-section-number">7.0.1</span> Student EMR Notes Policy</h3>
<p>Approved: Medical Education Division of Canopy Team 11/17/13</p>
<p>Students:</p>
<p>Should write Notes in the EMR as a part of their training. Students must sign and forward their notes. It is imperative that student notes not be saved and forwarded prior to signing the note or the authorship of the note will change. Signed notes should be forwarded to the supervising physician as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Supervising physicians:</p>
<p>Attending must sign the necessary documents per the medical staff bylaws (e.g., H &amp; P’s and Discharge Summaries). Attendings, residents, or fellows can cosign progress notes. Each attending should clarify who is responsible for signing progress notes.</p>
<p>Supervising physicians have 2 options:</p>
<p>Correct the note as needed, append an attestation, and sign within 24 hours. When appending the student’s note, the supervising physician may utilize only the student’s past medical history, family history, social history, and review of systems. This is the preferred model and the most efficient. Please see example below.*</p>
<p>Correct the note as needed, attest with reference to supervising physician’s own note, and sign within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Example Attending Attestation*</p>
<p>I have discussed the presentation of the patient with the student. I have also independently seen and examined the patient. Please see my documentation below:</p>
<p>History: [As obtained by the provider]</p>
<p>Past History, Family History, Social History, and ROS: Please see the student’s note above.</p>
<p>Physical Exam:</p>
<p>General: Well-developed, well-nourished</p>
<p>HEENT: Pupils equal react to light extra ocular motion intact, conjunctiva pink, anicteric sclera, oropharynx clear, moist mucosa</p>
<p>Neck: Supple, no meningeal signs</p>
<p>Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, bilateral breath sounds, normal effort</p>
<p>Cardiac: Regular rate normal rhythm, no murmur gallop or rub</p>
<p>Abdomen: Soft, benign, non-distended, non-tender, no mass</p>
<p>Extremities: Moves all 4 extremities, pulses 2+ and equal</p>
<p>Neurologic: Awake, alert, and oriented x3, cranial nerves II through XII are intact, moves all 4 extremities equally, speech is normal, affect pleasant</p>
<p>Skin: No rash</p>

<div id="weaning-tube-feeds" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2 number="8.1"><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Weaning Tube Feeds</h2>
<p>As outpatients begin eating more orally, their tube feeds are reduced.</p>
<p>Weaning from 5 cans to 4 cans: Easiest method is to maintain the same schedule (16 hours) and reduce insulin dosage by 20%. For instance, the above patient who is on 5 cans at 75mL/hour x 16 hours is receiving 16N + 8R at start of tube feeds and 6 hours later. This patient could be weaned by reducing rate form 75mL/hour x 16 hours to 60mL/hour x 16 hours and reducing insulin to 12N + 6R at the start of tube feeds AND another dose of 12N + 6R after 6 hours.</p>
<p>Weaning from 4 cans to 3 cans: One option is to decrease the duration of tube feeds from 16 hours to 12 hours, while maintaining rate of 60mL/hour. In this case, the insulin dosage could be kept the same at the start of tube feeds, BUT the dose 6 hours after the start of tube feeds could be omitted.</p>
<p>Once patients are on 3 cans per night, further weaning can be accomplished by skipping tube feeds (and insulin) every other night in a “tube feed holiday.” This allows an evening of interrupted sleep and can tend to increase the appetite the morning after tube feeds are held.</p>

<h1 number="12"><span class="header-section-number">12</span> Esophagectomy Postop</h1>
<p><strong>ICU Care</strong></p>
<p>All patients admitted to STICU with Surgical Critical Care Consultation. Surgical critical care will need a phone call immediately after surgery at 6-0366. Listed: Dr Salo, CMC-GI Surgical Oncology, CMC-Surgical Critical Care. Diabetic patients (on insulin preop): Consult Kelli Dunn.</p>
<p><strong>Ward Care</strong></p>
<p>Once stable, patients are transferred to 6T. If a 6T bed is not available, please notify Dr Salo. Historically, over 95% of patients are transferred to 6T after leaving the ICU.</p>
<p><strong>Neuro</strong></p>
<p>Multimodal pain control:</p>
<ul>
<li>gabapentin (300mg tid liquid via Jejunostomy)</li>
<li>Tylenol (1000mg q6hrs as pediatric liquid via Jejunostomy).</li>
<li>PCA with subsequent conversion to oxycodone elixir via Jejunostomy.</li>
<li>No ketorolac (Toradol) given risk of anastomotic failure​1​</li>
<li>Home anxiolytics are generally administered at half the home dose</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular</strong></p>
<p>Postoperative atrial fibrillation is a common occurrence (20%) after esophagectomy, with the risk increasing in older patients. For patients over age 70, half of patients will develop atrial fibrillation in the postoperative period.</p>
<p>For prevention of atrial fibrillation, beta blockade is used. For patients receiving beta blockers prior to surgery, continuation of beta blockade is recommended. For others, patients are given metoprolol 2.5 mg IV q6hrs which can be titrated up to 10mg IV q6hrs as needed. See STS Guidelines.​2​</p>
<p>Home anti-hypertensives are usually held in order to allow beta-blockade. Patients who have elevated blood pressures once they are adequately beta-blocked (eg HR 60-70) are usually restarted on their home anti-hypertensives. <em>Home anti-hypertensives are not routinely restarted postoperatively</em></p>
<p><strong>Respiratory</strong></p>
<p>Chest tubes generally consist of a 28Fr Blake drain placed into the right chest. This is placed to water seal when output is less than 200mL/day and there is no leak visible in the Pleurevac container. Chest tubes are usually removed once output is less than 150mL/day and drainage is clear without evidence of chyle (milky appearance). A chest x-ray is obtained after removing a chest tube to look for a pneumothorax.</p>
<p><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong>
All patients receive pantoprazole 40mg IV daily and metoclopramide 5-10mg IV q 6hrs</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>
<p>All esophagectomy patients receive a feeding jejunostomy at the time of operation. In the immediate post-operative period, patients receive Osmolite 1.5 starting the day of surgery once they are off pressors. Tube feeds are started at 20mL/hour until flatus and then advanced at 10mL per hour every 8 hours, up to a goal of 60mL per hour (x24 hours). Patients who are on tube feeds prior to surgery are generally restarted on their home tube feed formula.</p>
<p>Patients who do not tolerate Osmolite are switched to Vital 1.5, which is pre-hydrolyzed. In order to allow enough time for switching of tube feedings, patients are generally switched from Vital to their home tube feeding formula 3-4 days prior to discharge. This is typically done when they are transferred out of the ICU.</p>
<p>Obese patients (BMI&gt;30) are started on Promote at 20mL/hour and increased to a goal of 60mL/hour. Promote contains a more protein relative to carbohydrdates. An alternative is Vital High Protein, which is similar to Promote but using hydrolyzed proteins.</p>
<p>Diarrhea in patients on tube feeds (especially nocturnal diarrhea) needs to be addressed. Despite STICU guidelines for nutrition in trauma patients, diarrhea (especially night-time diarrhea) is justification for alteration in tube feeds. See Diarrhea and Jejunstomy Feeding</p>
<p><em>Diabetic Patients</em></p>
<p>Patients who require EndoTool in the ICU will need an endocrinology consult. See also <a href="#jejunostomy_diabetes">Jejunostomy Feedings with Diabetes</a></p>
<p><em>‘Free Water’</em></p>
<p>In addition to tube feeds, most patients will receive ‘free’ water flushes through the jejunostomy. This is typically done as 240mL four times per day (for a total of 32oz)</p>
<p><em>Nasogastric Tubes</em></p>
<p>A silicone nasogastric tube (Covidien Salem Sump) is placed in all patients during surgery and the position confirmed by ultrasound intraoperatively. Tubes are positioned so that all 4 dots are outside. Gastric emptying is evaluated with upper GI prior to NG tube removal. Once extubated, upper GI is typically performed on the 2nd through 4th postoperative day. Conversely, patients who are intubated will keep their nasogastric tube until extubated. Radiology ordered as “upper GI Series.” In the comments section please add “IsoVue through NG tube. Halo Dr Salo for study.” See Evaluation of GI Function</p>
<p><em>Drains</em></p>
<ul>
<li>JP1: 19Fr Blake drain in left pleura. The exit site the most lateral drain and is secured with a blue suture</li>
<li>JP2: 19Fr Blake drain in right pleura. The exit site is medial to JP1 and is secured with a black suture</li>
<li>JP3: 19 Fr Blake drain in abdomen. If used, the exit site is most medial and is secured with a blue suture</li>
<li>JP4: 15Fr Blake drain in neck (for cervial incision)</li>
<li>JP5: 15Fr Blake drain in subcutaneous tissue of incision</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Evaluation for Anastomotic leak</em></p>
<p><a href="#drain_amylase">Drain amylase</a> is an inexpensive, specific, and relatively sensitive test for anastomotic leak. Fluid from JP2 (right chest) is sent for “Body Fluid Amylase” starting on postoperative day #4 and continued until postoperative day 9. Drain amylase over 400IU/ml is considered positive and prompts a <a href="#ct_esophagram">CT esophagram</a> for confirmation. See also <a href="#leak_evaluation">Evaluation for Anastomotic Leak</a></p>
<p><strong>Renal</strong>
Total fluids (IV + tube feeds) are generally run at 75mL/hour. Foley catheter is removed on the first or second day after surgery. Some patients will need diuresis on the 3rd or 4th postoperative day</p>
<p><strong>Heme</strong>
All patients require VTE prophylaxis with Lovenox or heparin SQ.</p>
<p>Preoperative anti-platelet agents are started on the first (aspirin) or second (Plavix) postoperative day if there is no excessive bleeding from the chest tube or JP drains. Patients on preoperative anticoagulation are transitioned to therapeutic Lovenox on the second postoperative day if no signs of bleeding.</p>

<h2 number="13.4"><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> Evaluation for leak</h2>
<p>Experience suggests that the median time to the diagnosis of leak is 7 day after surgery. Currently the risk of anastomotic leak at CMC after transthoracic esophagectomy is 2%. The most sensitive test for the diagnosis of leak is CT esophagram (see below). Based upon institutional experience, patients are divided into low risk of leak vs high risk for leak based upon drain amylase level and white blood cell count. Patients with a normal drain amylase (400IU/ml) between postoperative day 4 and day 7 AND white blood cell count less than 12 are considered low risk. Patients with either an elevated drain amylase or WBC greater than 12 are evaluated with CT esophagram. In a group of 100 patients, several were found to have elevated drain amylase in the first four days (up to 2000Iu/ml) which subsequently declined, and no evidence of leak was found</p>
<div id="drain_amylase" class="section level3" number="13.4.1">
<h3 number="13.4.1"><span class="header-section-number">13.4.1</span> Drain Amylase</h3>
<p>JP2 is placed into the right pleura, passes through the hiatus, and is brought out through a trocar site in the medial left upper quadrant. Drain amylase from JP2 is tested beginning on postoperative day #4 until discharge or postoperative day #9. JP2 is generally removed prior to patient discharge. JP1 is placed in the left pleura and is generally not tested for amylase.</p>
</div>
<div id="ct_esophagram" class="section level3" number="13.4.2">
<h3 number="13.4.2"><span class="header-section-number">13.4.2</span> CT esophagram</h3>
<p>This is the most sensitive study for the detection of anastomotic leak. In order to obtain sufficient sensitivity, it requires a pre-contrast scan and the administration of contrast into the esophagus. The need for a pre-contrast scan means that the presence of remnant barium in the esophagus (from a Modified Barium Swallow) makes it more difficult to interpret the scan and should be avoided. Awake patients can drink the contrast. Patients with an NG tube present at the time of the study generally will have contrast administered through their NG tube. Almost all esophagectomy patients will have a Covidien silicone Salem Sump 18Fr tube in place. This has four marks on the tube at 45, 55, 65, and 75cm. The tube is typically positioned with the 4th mark at the nares, which means that the tip is 45cm from the nares and is usually within the gastric conduit AND below the anastomosis. The NG tube also contains side holes which extend 8.5cm above the tip of the tube. The optimal study is done with the NG tube withdrawn so that there are two side-holes above the anastomosis, which means that the tip is approximately 6cm below the anastomosis. A scout CT will be performed, and the radiologist will determine how far back the NG tube needs to be withdrawn. This is communicated to the CT technician, who asks the nurse (or physician) to withdraw the tube the calculated amount (making a note of the starting position of the tube relative to the four marks). This should keep the tip below the level of the anastomosis, so that after the CT scan, the NG tube can be (blindly) advanced back to its original position (at approximately 45cm from the nares).</p>
<p>Patients who clinically deteriorate prior to post-operative day 7 in whom there is high suspicion for a leak (fevers, pleural effusion on chest X-ray, elevated JP amylase, respiratory failure) will undergo a CT esophagram earlier than post-operative day 7.</p>

<div id="anastomotic-leak-treatment" class="section level2" number="13.5">
<h2 number="13.5"><span class="header-section-number">13.5</span> Anastomotic Leak Treatment</h2>
<p>If a patient is demonstrated to have a leak, they are made NPO AND will have any pleural effusion treated with a pigtail catheter. Conservative management will generally be successful for most patients with leaks provided 1) there is no evidence of conduit necrosis 2) nutrition is optimized and 3) empyema is treated. Patients with leaks may even need a decortication, which emphasizes the importance of CT scan in the sick post-operative esophagectomy patient, so that an empyema can be diagnosed and treated. Patients with leaks who show signs of systemic illness may need to be considered for an intraluminal stent. Patients who are profoundly ill need to be evaluated for gastric necrosis with upper endoscopy.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p>
<p>All esophagectomy patients receive a feeding jejunostomy at the time of operation. In the immediate post-operative period, patients receive Osmolite 1.5 starting the day of surgery once they are off pressors.

<p>Patients who do not tolerate Osmolite are switched to Vital 1.5, which is pre-hydrolyzed. In order to allow enough time for switching of tube feedings, patients are generally switched from Vital to their home tube feeding formula 3-4 days prior to discharge. This is typically done when they are transferred out of the ICU.</p>
<p>Obese patients (BMI&gt;30) are started on Promote at 20mL/hour and increased to a goal of 60mL/hour. Promote contains a more protein relative to carbohydrdates. An alternative is Vital High Protein, which is similar to Promote but using hydrolyzed proteins.</p>
<p>Diarrhea in patients on tube feeds (especially nocturnal diarrhea) needs to be addressed. Despite STICU guidelines for nutrition in trauma patients, diarrhea (especially night-time diarrhea) is justification for alteration in tube feeds. See Diarrhea and Jejunstomy Feeding</p>
<p><em>Diabetic Patients</em></p>
<p>Patients on tube feeds are typically started on continuous (around-the-clock) tube feedings, and subsequently changed to a nocturnal regimen (typically 6pm to 10am). See <a href="#jejunostomy_diabetes">Jejunostomy Feeds in Diabetic Patients</a></p>
<p><em>‘Free Water’</em></p>
<p>In addition to tube feeds, most patients will receive ‘free’ water flushes through the jejunostomy. This is typically done as 240mL four times per day (for a total of 32oz)</p>
<p><em>Nasogastric Tubes</em></p>
<p>A silicone nasogastric tube (Covidien Salem Sump) is placed in all patients during surgery and the position confirmed by ultrasound intraoperatively. Tubes are positioned so that all 4 dots are outside. Gastric emptying is evaluated with upper GI prior to NG tube removal. Once extubated, upper GI is typically performed on the 2nd through 4th postoperative day. Conversely, patients who are intubated will keep their nasogastric tube until extubated.</p>
<p><em>Drains</em></p>
<ul>
<li>JP1: 19Fr Blake drain in left pleura. The exit site the most lateral drain and is secured with a blue suture</li>
<li>JP2: 19Fr Blake drain in right pleura. The exit site is medial to JP1 and is secured with a black suture</li>
<li>JP3: 19 Fr Blake drain in abdomen. If used, the exit site is most medial and is secured with a blue suture</li>
<li>JP4: 15Fr Blake drain in neck (for cervial incision)</li>
<li>JP5: 15Fr Blake drain in subcutaneous tissue of incision</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Evaluation for Anastomotic leak</em></p>
<p>Drain amylase is an inexpensive, specific, and relatively sensitive test for anastomotic leak. Fluid from JP2 (right chest) is sent for “Body Fluid Amylase” starting on postoperative day #4 and continued until postoperative day 9. Drain amylase over 400IU/ml is considered positive and prompts a CT esophagram for confirmation. See also Evaluation for Anastomotic Leak</p>
<p><strong>Renal</strong>
Total fluids (IV + tube feeds) are generally run at 75mL/hour. Foley catheter is removed on the first or second day after surgery. Some patients will need diuresis on the 3rd or 4th postoperative day</p>
<p><strong>Heme</strong>
All patients require VTE prophylaxis with Lovenox or heparin SQ.</p>
<p>Preoperative anti-platelet agents are started on the first (aspirin) or second (Plavix) postoperative day if there is no excessive bleeding from the chest tube or JP drains. Patients on preoperative anticoagulation are transitioned to therapeutic Lovenox on the second postoperative day if no signs of bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>ID</strong>
Prophylactic Cefazolin and Flagyl are administered for 24 hours and stopped</p>
<p>Discharge Medicines
Patients after esophagectomy typically go home with the following medicines:</p>
<p>Proton pump inhibitors (will continue for 2 years)
Oxycodone elixir via feeding tube. Current STOP guidelines dictate that patients receive no more than a 7 day supply of opiods at discharage
Reglan 10mg po qid (will stop at 6 weeks post-op)
Remeron 15mg qhs (will continue for 3 months post-op)
Tylenol 1000mg q6 hours as elixir (pediatric form)
Gabapentin 300mg as liquid tid x 14 days
Metoprolol if started postoperatively (most patients). If not on beta blockers preoperatively, this will be cut in half at the first visit and stopped at the second postoperative visit. It is important to limit the use of medicines via jejunostomy in order to lower the risk of clogging the feeding tube. While liquid metoprolol is available for inpatients, it is not available from outpatient pharmacies.</p>

<h1 number="14"><span class="header-section-number">14</span> Jejunostomy Feedings</h1>
<p>Due to the osmotic load, jejunostomy feedings are given via enteral (Kangaroo) pump rather than bolus feeding. Feedings are generally begun as continuous (around-the-clock) and are then transitioned to nocturnal (generally 6pm to 10am) prior to discharge.</p>
<p>Jejunostomy feedings carry a small but significant risk (~1%) of small bowel necrosis, as evidenced by the findings of pneumatosis on CT scan and in some cases small bowel necrosis and perforation. The existing literature would suggest that the early symptoms associated with small bowel necrosis are abdominal distension. As a result, patients on jejunostomy tube feeding need to be carefully monitored for distension, and tube feeds held if distension develops.​1​ Tube feeds are generally started at 30mL/hour in the immediate postoperative patients. In patients who are awake and in whom it is possible to determine whether or not there are issues of tube feed intolerance, the rate of tube feedings is increased 10mL/hour every 8 hours to a goal of 60mL/hour. In patients who are intubated/sedated, the advancement of tube feeds is individualized, and decisions are made on a daily basis on rounds.</p>
<p>Choice of Tube Feed Formula</p>
<p>Options for formulas for jejunostomy feedings:</p>
<p>Osmolite 1.5: First-line formula for BMI &lt;35</p>
<pre><code>Intact protein 14.8 grams
Carbohydrates 48.2 grams
Fat 11.6 grams</code></pre>
<p>Vital 1.5: Second-line formula (intolerant of Osmolite) for BMI&lt;35</p>
<pre><code>Peptide protein 16 grams
Carbohydrates 44.2 grams
Fat 13.5 grams</code></pre>
<p>Vivonex: Third-line formula (intolerant of Vital) or for ultra-low fat diet (eg chylous leak)</p>
<pre><code>Amino Acids 12.5 grams
Carbohydrates 44 grams
Fat 2.9 grams</code></pre>
<p>Promote: First-line formula for BMI &gt;35 or diabetics</p>
<pre><code>Peptide protein 14.8 grams
Carbohydrates 30.8 grams
Fat 16.2 grams</code></pre>
<p>Vital High Protein: Second-line formula for BMI &gt;35</p>
<pre><code>Peptide protein 20.7 grams
Carbohydrates 26.7 grams
Fat 5.5 grams</code></pre>
<p>For patients who receive tube feedings preoperatively, the same formula is generally used after surgery.</p>
<p>For patients with BMI less than 35, Osmolite 1.5 is used as a starting formula. If Osmolite is not tolerated due to diarrhea, Vital 1.5 can be used. For patients with BMI greater than 35, Promote is used as a starting formula, as it contains a lower amount of carbohydrates then Osmolite 1.5. Patients who are intolerant to Promote can be switched to Vital High Protein.</p>
<p>Patients less than 150 pounds receive 4 cans of tube feedings, administered at 60mL/hour x 16 hours (6pm to 10am). Patients greater than 150 pounds receive 5 cans of tube feedings, administered at 75mL/hour x 16 hours (6pm to 10am). Patients with BMI &gt;35 receive 5 cans of Promote (or Vital High Protein).</p>
<p>Glucerna is formulated with carbohydrates with low glycemic index, which is particularly helpful for bolus feeding (via gastrostomy) or patients who are eating. Glycemic index is less important in patients on continuous tube feeds (eg via jejunostomy). In addition, the high fiber context of Glucerna may make this formula more prone to causing clogging of jejunostomy tubes.
Free Water Flushes</p>
<p>Once patients are transferred to the ward, free water via jejunostomy should be ordered as 240mL via jejunostomy qid. This is entered under Flush Enteral Tube for Free Water Requirements.
Diarrhea with Jejunostomy Feedings</p>
<p>Patients who experience diarrhea during jejunostomy administration (especially diarrhea at night) will need this addressed. Several steps</p>
<pre><code>- Send stool for C Diff
- Consider changing tube feedings to a more easily digestible formula. Patients on Osmolite 1.5 can be changed to Vital 1.5. Patients on Vital 1.5 can be changed to Vivonex. Patients on Promote can be changed to Vital High Protein
- Stop tube feedings for 2-4 hours to allow diarrhea to resolve
- restart tube feeds at a lower rate (eg 20mL/hour lower than the prior rate).
- Bannatrol can be given to patients taking an oral diet. Bannatrol is NOT given via jejunostomy tube to avoid clogging.
- Lomotil is generally used as a last resort.</code></pre>

<p>As patients increase their oral intake as outpatients, tube feeds are gradually weaned.</p>
<p>Patients on 5 cartons/day (75mL/hour x 16 hours) can be reduced to 4 cartons/day (60mL/hour x 16 hours) with a 20% reduction of insulin at initiation of tube feeds and 6 hours later.</p>
<p>Patients on 4 cartons/day (60mL/hour x 16 hours) can be reduced to 3 cartons/day (60mL/hour x 12 hours) while continuing the same insulin dose at the initiation of tube feeds and omitting the insulin dose 6 hours later.</p>
<p>Patients taking 3 cartons/day are weaned by changing to every other day administration of tube feeds (and insulin). On evening when tube feeds are not given, insulin is not administered.</p>

<h2 number="14.4"><span class="header-section-number">14.4</span> Jejunostomy + Diabetes</h2>
<p><strong>Inpt – Jejunostomy ~ Diabetes</strong></p>
<p>Patients on tube feeds are typically started on continuous (around-the-clock) tube feedings, and subsequently changed to a nocturnal regimen (typically 6pm to 10am). The diabetic management for these patients differs depending upon their tube feeding regimen:</p>
<p><strong>Diabetics on Continuous Tube Feeds.</strong></p>
<p>Non-insulin diabetic patients are generally initially given Osmolite 1.5 as it provides higher caloric density and does not contain fiber, which tends to clog the feeding tubes. Diabetic patients requiring insulin can be initially trialed on Osmolite 1.5 but are changed to Promote or Glucerna 1.5 if their blood sugars prove difficult to control (as evidence by either the need for EndoTool or requiring a q6 hour regimen of insulin N + insulin R).</p>
<p>Diabetic patients who need insulin while receiving tube feedings are typically treated initially with continuous tube feedings and around-the-clock insulin. Patients with large insulin requirements may need hourly intravenous insulin (with dosages calculated via EndoTool). Once their insulin requirements are stabilized, they are transitioned to a q6 hour regimen consisting of N and R insulin, typically twice as many units of N insulin as R (for instance, 6Units of N + 3 Units of R insulin every six hours). Patients who require EndoTool or a q6hr regimen need an endocrinology consultation with Dr Kelli Dunn to assist in diabetic management.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetics on Nocturnal Tube Feeds</strong></p>
<p>Most patients are transitioned from continuous tube feeds to nocturnal prior to discharge. Diabetic patients on nocturnal tube feedings typically receive tube feeding from 6pm to 10am and receive insulin at initiation of tube feeds (6pm) and again at 6 hours later (midnight). A typical regimen might be 18U of 70/30 at 1800 and 18U of 70/30 at MN. An alternative might be 12U NPH + 6U Regular at 1800 and 16U NPH and 8U Regular insulin at MN. Because it can take several days to determine the correct insulin regimen, diabetic patients receiving jejunostomy feedings are cycled as early in their hospital course as possible to avoid delaying discharge for blood sugar management.</p>
<p>Diabetic patients receiving insulin will need careful coordination of tube feeding and insulin administration when they are being transitioned from continuous to nocturnal tube feeds. Patients on continuous tube feeds may receive insulin on a q6 hour schedule, while those receiving nocturnal tube feeds receive insulin at 1800 and MN. When patients on continuous tube feeds are transitioned, the tube feeds are stopped at 10am, to be restarted at 6pm that evening. It is critical that as soon as the tube feeds are stopped at 10am, that the q6 hour insulin as stopped as well.</p>
<p>In either case it is critical that if tube feedings are stopped, standing insulin administration (either q6 hour OR 1800 and MN) be stopped as well. In these cases, sliding scale insulin is generally continued.</p>

<p>In this example, the patient was receiving 8N + 4R every 6 hours, so total insulin units per day is (8+4) x 4 = 48units. Because the carbohydrate load of 60mL/hour x 24 is roughly equivalent to 75mL/hour x 16 hours, the total insulin administered is roughly the same. When converted to nocturnal dosing, the patient now received 16+8 = 24 units twice (6pm and MN) = 48U. In practice, it may be wiser to begin by adjusting the dose down a little, to perhaps 14U N and 7U R for the first night.</p>

<p><em>Trendelenburg</em></p>
<p>Right internal jugular vein is identified and its course cephalad-caudad marked on the skin.</p>
<p>Finder needle (22Ga) <em>OR</em> micropuncture kit passed into IJ. The needle should enter the vein directly beneath the ultrasound probe.</p>
<p>Skin anesthetized and transverse 8mm counter-incision made at needle entry site</p>
<p><em>Respiration held by anesthesia</em></p>
<p>16Ga needle passed into IJ under sono. It is essential that the vein is scanned up and down by ‘rocking’ the probe to visualize the tip of the needle as it passes inferior.</p>
<p>J Wire passed through 16Ga needle and needle withdrawn</p>
<p><em>Anesthesia resumes respirations</em></p>
<p>Ultrasound used to confirm presence of wire within the vein by scanning up and down.</p>
<p><em>Level bed</em></p>
<p>Fluoroscopy used to confirm position of wire. Dilator and sheath inserted under fluoroscopic visualization (‘live’). C-arm backed away off field.</p>
<p>Tunneler connected to tubing on the end with small numbers. Confirm that the collar is in place and place hemostat on the end of the tubing with large numbers (to avoid allowing the collar to fall off). Tunneler bent into a curve to avoid injury to the carotid artery.</p>
<p>Catheter tunneled from port pocket to counter-incision over SCM. The tunneler path describes a gentle arc to avoid kinking the catheter. 1 cm of catheter near tunneler trimmed.</p>
<p>Catheter placed through dilator into central circulation. Most of the catheter is inserted. The catheter will generally not cause arrhythmias.</p>
<p>C-arm brought back onto field.</p>
<p>Peel-away sheath split and removed.</p>
<p>Traction on catheter from the port pocket is used to position catheter approximately 3cm below carina. It may be necessary to ‘orbit’ the C-arm if the catheter overlies the spine.</p>
<p>Port pocket is measured and catheter trimmed (after sliding collar superior) and attached to port. It is essential that the catheter come to rest within 1mm of the port before locking the collar in place. In order to avoid pulling on the catheter (and changing the position of the catheter tip) the port is rotated (not the catheter). Collar is locked in place.</p>
<p>Port accessed with straight Huber needle with 100U/ml heparinized saline. Blood is withdrawn into port. Needle is left in the port and the syringe detached. Syringe with concentrated flush (1000U/ml) is attached to the needle and the port flushed (without aspiration of blood). Syringe and needle are removed.</p>
<p>Port sutured to the underlying pectoralis fascia with 2 sutures of 3-0 Prolene, one forehand and one backhand. Sutures are tied and cut.</p>
<p>The port pocket irrigated and the incision closed with subcutaneous 3-0 Vicryl followed by subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl. The skin is dressed with Dermabond.</p>

<p>Abdominal access is obtained in one of two ways:</p>
<p>Infraumbilical approach using modified Hasson technique. If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port (Applied Medical Kii Fios First Entry Z-Thread Trocar)
Veress needle inserted in LEFT upper quadrant just inferior to costal margin. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical Z-Thread port.
5mm port in right upper quadrant, 5mm port in RLQ just lateral to rectus, 5mm camera port between RUQ and RLQ ports</p>
<p>The transverse colon is now elevated (using the umbilical port, if used) and the ligament of Treitz is identified. The proximal bowel is arranged in a “C” configuration to confirm the proximal and distal ends of bowel.</p>
<p>A site for placement of the jejunostomy is selected on the skin, left lateral and just superior to the umbilicus. A site is selected on the bowel in the most proximal site on the jejunostomy selected which would allow for placement of the jejunostomy without tension, but at least 20cm from ligament of Treitz.</p>
<p>The proximal jejunum is sutured to the anterior abdominal wall with 2-0 silk. This is usually done with a 9″ suture which is introduced into the abdomen with a needle driver “Korean Style” or “Paraguayan Style.” Two cm distal to this suture, a diamond of sutures is placed around the proposed tube site, and one suture placed distal to avoid torsion. The final arrangement of sutures is one proximal and one distal and 4-6 sutures around the tube. All sutures were marked with hemostatic clips to facilitate replacement of the tube via fluoroscopy should the tube become dislodged.</p>
<p>Using Seldinger technique, a 16Fr Cook catheter introducer kit is placed within the jejunum.</p>
<p>A MIC 14Fr jejunostomy tube (0301-14) with the tabs trimmed with a scalpel, is inserted through the sheath and positioned in the jejunum. The tube was secured with a suture of 0 silk.</p>
<p>If a balloon tube is used, an 18Fr Cook dilater and sheath is used, followed by a MIC 14Fr jejunustomy tube (0200-14) and the balloon inflated with 7mL of sterile WATER.</p>
<p>The tube is secured with 0 silk and dressed with a BioPatch and a Tagederm dressing.</p>
<p>The abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl, followed by dermabond.</p>
<p>After dressings are applied, a Lopez valve is attached with the long Christmas-tree end placed into the jejunostomy tube.</p>
<p>Endoscopy
The scope is set up:</p>
<p>Suction and aspiration valves inserted and working
Suction tubing attached
Biopsy valve attached and not leaking
Cart set up for recording by powering on the Stryker SDC digital capture box
A bite block is used and the scope lubricated. A neonatal scope may be necessary in patients with a tight stricture. Important findings to record:</p>
<p>Level in cm from the incisors, of the most proximal area of Barrett’s esophagus.
Level in cm from the incisors of the GE junction
Appearance of the GE junction on retroflexed view. Extent of invasion of the tumor into the cardia or fundus.
The scope is withdrawn and the hypopharynx suctioned. The liquid from the ‘First Step’ disinfectant is suctioned through the scope, followed by water.</p>

<p><strong>Prep</strong></p>
<p>Chloroprep (two sticks) of abdomen (need to keep pubis in field, as well as right anterior superior iliac spine), both costal margins.</p>
<p>If port: RIGHT chest, neck to chin and earlobe, shoulder to include deltopectoral groove</p>
<p><strong>Indications</strong></p>
<p>Laparoscopic gastrostomy is used in patients with esophageal obstruction . Gastrostomy feedings are much easier than jejunostomy, as they can be administered via syringe or gravity bag. By contrast, jejunostomy feedings require administration via pump. Gastrostomy is usually done as an outpatient unless there are concerns for refeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Review Clinical Information (Resident)</strong></p>
<p>Review staging scans (especially PET scan) to identify suspicious areas on imaging which need to be investigated at the time of laparoscopy
Outpatient anticoagulation use (warfarin, Xaralto, aspirin, Plavix)
Review dietitian’s recommendations (how many cartons per day?)</p>
<p><strong>Drape</strong></p>
<p>If central venous port: Perimeter of field draped with 1000 (clear adhesive) drapes. Four 1000 drapes around port site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medial border: From Angle of Louis superiorly along midline to chin.</li>
<li>Superior border: Inferior to jaw (to allow access to right internal jugular vein and SCM)</li>
<li>Laterally: From inferior to ear down to right shoulder</li>
<li>Inferior: From lateral shoulder medially to Angle of Louis</li>
</ul>
<p>Abdomen: Blue adhesive drapes used inferiorly keeping pubis and right anterior inferior iliac spine in field. This is critical as the far inferior/lateral RLQ needs to be in the field for optimal port placement if the patient needs a jejunostomy.</p>
<p>Six Blue Adhesive Drapes around perimeter of field (on top of 1000 drapes)</p>
<p>If central venous port: Transverse sheet TURNED HEAD-TO-FOOT turned at an angle to keep deltopectoral groove and SCM within the field</p>
<p>Laparoscopy drape skewed to inferior and right to keep pubis and right ASIS in the field.</p>
<p>Turn on Bair Hugger only AFTER drapes in place</p>
<p><strong>Operation</strong></p>
<p>If a central venous port is placed, the port is performed first. See <a href="#cv_port_salo">IJ Port</a></p>
<p><strong>Abdominal access</strong> is obtained in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Veress needle inserted in left upper quadrant just inferior to costal margin. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical port at lateral border of rectus just superior to umbilicus</li>
<li>Infraumbilical approach using modified Hasson technique. If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port</li>
</ul>
<p>The insufflation pressure is decreased to 4mmHg and the abdomen vented to drop the pressure. A 30 degree scope is passed inferior to the falciform ligament into the left upper quadrant over the lateral segment of liver. The post of the scope is positioned to the left, allowing visualization of the lesser curvature of the stomach with the end of the scope near the left aspect of the falciform.</p>
<p>A site for placement of the gastrostomy is selected on the skin, using a 22Ga needle as a finder. The site is marked, then infiltrated with local anesthetic and a 5mm transverse incision made.</p>
<p>Endoscopy is performed and the following noted:</p>
<p>Level in cm from the incisors, of the most proximal area of Barrett’s esophagus.
Level in cm from the incisors of the GE junction
Appearance of the GE junction on retroflexed view. Extent of invasion of the tumor into the cardia or fundus.</p>
<p>A bite block is positioned (unless the patient is edentulous). The endoscope (usually a neonatal scope) is introduced into the esophagus and the video capture started. If the tumor will not allow passage of the scope, do not force the scope.</p>
<p>Once the scope is passed into the stomach, the fundus and duodenal bulb are suctioned.</p>
<p>Insufflation is then reduced to 4mm and the stomach insufflated to find the optimal location for tube placement which will minimize tension and will avoid injury to the right gastroepiploic artery. The reduced laparoscopic insufflation pressure allows endoscopic insufflation of the stomach.</p>
<p>Gastrostomy tube placement is done either by Pull or Seldinger technique.</p>
<p><strong>Seldinger Gastrostomy</strong></p>
<p>Four T-fasteners are then used to affix the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall. These are arranged at 8:00, 10:00, 2:00, 4:00 relative to the proposed tube site. T-fasteners are not placed inferior to the tube site to avoid injury to right gastroepiploic vessels.</p>
<p>The J wire is then passed into the stomach, followed by the dilators, up to 20Fr. A 16Fr MIC gastrostomy tube is introduced and the balloon inflated with 5mL of <em>water</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Pull Gastrostomy</strong></p>
<p>A 20Fr PULL PEG tube kit is opened. The snare and tube are passed to the upper operator. The snare is passed through the scope and opened in anticipation of the passage of the wire.</p>
<p>The angiocath from the kit is placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Once the snare has grasped the angiocath, the needle is withdrawn and the split wire passed through the Angiocath into the stomach. The snare is adjusted to grasp the split wire, which is pulled out through the mouth.</p>
<p>The laparoscopic port site is considered clean. The PEG tube, once it is pulled through the mouth, is considered dirty. The right abdomen is covered with a towel to protect the laparoscopic site.</p>
<p>The recording is now stopped. The split wire is joined to the PEG tube, which is pulled into place by the abdominal operator. The tapered portion of the tube will be the first source of resistance, which may require firm traction. The split wire (and PEG tube) is dropped of the table to the patient’s left.</p>
<p>Once the tapered portion of the tube is through the abdominal wall skin, the next point of resistance will be the bumper of the PEG tube passing through the tumor. In general, if a 5mm neonatal scope can pass the tumor, a 20Fr PEG tube can pass as well.</p>
<p>The tube is pulled into position and the measurement at the skin noted. The stomach is aspirated by the upper operator and insufflation is resumed at 8mmHg. Tension on the PEG tube is adjusted to allow apposition of the gastric serosa to the abdominal wall. If the tube is not easily apposed to the abdominal wall, T fasteners (“GI Anchors”) must be employed.</p>
<p>The scope is withdrawn and the hypopharynx suctioned. The liquid from the ‘First Step’ disinfectant is suctioned through the scope, followed by water.</p>
<p>The abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl.</p>

<h1 number="19"><span class="header-section-number">19</span> Esophagectomy One Stage</h1>
<p>Indications</p>
<p>MI Ivor Lewis (“One Stage”) esophagectomy is the most common approach to esophagectomy. The patient is positioned in ‘corkscrew’ position to allow simultaneous access to the abdomen and chest by prepping both abdomen and chest. Room Prep</p>
<p>Confirm positioning equipment (Salo positioner ‘bucket’):</p>
<p>Four black side-rail clamps
Four rectangular lateral positioners
Yassargil socket OR large-bore Clark socket
Well-leg holder (used as an arm holder)
Review Clinical Information</p>
<p>Stentor open with initial PET scan (for surgical planning)
Review initial endoscopy report with attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most cephalad extend of Barrett’s esophagus</li>
<li>Invasion of tumor into gastric cardia and lesser curvature of stomach</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anesthesia</strong></p>
<p>Confirm that anesthesia has a copy of Dr Campbell’s protocol
Dual-lumen ETT tube (taped to left)
Arterial line (left arm will be on arm board)
Anesthesia may place paraspinal muscle blocks.</p>
<p>Position
Supine on blue foam pad without draw sheet. Surgeon marks upper midline with non-sterile skin marker Foley catheter (with Criticor temperature sensor) Bovie pad Lower-body Bair Hugger at level of thighs Hair clipped from abdomen, right chest, and right axilla with electric clippers. If jejunostomy in place, it is usually prepped into the field. If there is an eschar at the jejunostomy site, this should be removed prior to prep. Jejunostomy is brought inferior and taped to skin (or sutured to skin with a 0 silk suture with a Keith needle) Shoulders are shifted to the right in preparation for ‘corkscrew’ positioning Lateral positioners positioned with pad extending from greater trochanter inferiorly. Leather strap over thighs with strap inside of bars of lateral positioners Left arm on armboard Yassargil socket attached to headpiece of bed on left side. Well-leg holder attached to Yassargil socket and used to support right forearm (which will cross body) Right arm crosses body and is supported on well-leg holder.</p>
<p>Lateral positioner placed posterior to spine to support right chest in rolling to the left. This allows access to the right chest for thoracoscopy. Arm holder is dropped towards the floor enough that right arm is brought forward. Prep</p>
<p>Chloroprep (two sticks) of abdomen, right chest, right axilla. Particular attention to prepping as far as possible to the left lateral side and the right lateral side. Nipple prepped into field.</p>
<p>Drape
Perimeter of field draped with 1000 (clear adhesive) drapes. Two blue plastic “U” drapes with center of the “U” on either lateral side with tails forming the perimeter of the field Trauma drape. All of right chest and axilla is kept within the field, as is the lateral aspect of the left upper quadrant. The field does not need to extend inferior to the umbilicus. In general, it is usually possible to keep all of these area in the field without cutting the drape, except in very large patients. Ioban over the surgical field after the trauma drape. Laparoscopic cords (gas, light cord, camera) to tower at left shoulder. Suction irrigator brought off field at left shoulder. Laparoscopic LigaSure (2 bars) and Bovie (30/30).</p>

Anticipated Intraop Problems:

Expectation of ventilatory difficulties due to carbon dioxide entry into the right chest Gastric mobilization – Greater Curvature
Gastric Mobilization
After infiltration of 1% marcaine, 7cm upper midline incision made for handport. Small incision is made and pylorus palpated, if possible. Incision is centered over pylorus. GelPort inserted, and abdomen insufflated to 15mmHg. Two 5mm ports placed LUQ. Medial LUQ 5mm port placed in angle between left costal margin and interior edge of GelPort ring. Lateral LUQ 5mm port placed as far lateral as possible. Depending upon visualization, a third port may be required between these two and somewhat more inferior.</p>
<p>If feasible, division of gastrocolic omentum starts by delivering transverse colon into GelPort and dividing ligament with cautery and LigaSure in the avascular plane just cephalad to transverse colon. Dissection proceeds as far proximal and distal and feasible. It is important to avoid damage to the right gastroepiploic artery.</p>
<p>Colon is returned to abdomen and gastricolic ligament divided going using LigaSure, taking care to avoid the colon and the right gastroepiploic artery. Stomach is retracted to the patient’s right with the back of the left hand, placing the gastrocolic ligament (and short gastric arteries) on stretch. Left gastroepippoic artery divided with LigaSure near its origin. Short gastric arteries divided with Ligasure close to spleen. As superior aspect of short gastrics is reached, the dissection plane shifts medially to create a tunnel towards the base of the left crus. This places the most superior short gastric vessels on stretch and facilitates their division. Once all short gastric vessels divided, peritoneum tethering fundus to diaphragm is incised, and fundus brushed medially.</p>
<p>If there is bleeding from the splenic hilum this is treated with suction, LigaSure, SurgiFlo, and packing with a vaginal tape with laparotomy ring.</p>
<p>Dissection plane is brought medially and posterior attachments are divided between stomach and pancreas. This may require a Megadyne hook.</p>
<p>Distal mobilization
Attention is directed to mobilizing the lateral aspect of the duodenum. This can either be accomplished with the camera through a LUQ port and a 45 degree camera or by placing an additional 5mm port in the RLQ. Hook cautery is used to incise the connective tissue lateral and posterior to the duodenum. This is extended as far distal as the gastrocolic venous trunk. The gastrocolic ligament is now dissected distally, taking care to preserve the integrity of the right gastroepiploic vessels. An areolar plane generally exists between the fat pad containing the right gastroepiploic vessels and that containing the transverse mesocolon vessels.</p>
<p>Left gastric artery
Lymph nodes around the celiac axis and left gastric artery are now dissected. The extend of dissection depends upon the tumor location and the presence of nodes her either based upon imaging or palpation. Dissection begins on the superior edge of the pancreas, and proceeds superiorly to the right crus. The left gastric (coronary) vein is usually located to the left of the arery and is divided with the LigaSure. In a two-phase approach, the left gastric artery is now divided with a 30mm gray load (2.0mm) endoGIA linear stapler. For patients with mid-esophageal tumors, (for whom a four-phase approach is used), if there is any question about the resectability of the tumor, division of the left gastric gastric artery is generally deferred until the second abdominal phase.</p>
<p>Mediastinal dissection
The esophagus is now dissected circumferentially at the gastroesophageal junction. The peritoneum overlying the diaphragm is incised, and circumferential dissection of esopahgus performed. On the left side, it is helpful to distract the left crus laterally with a Prestige clamp placed on the left crus The right pleura is widely entered in otder to both facilitate the thoracic dissection of the esophagus and placing the conduit into the right chest in preparation for the final thoracic phase. Division of Esophagus (Two-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the right chest during the first (of two) thoracic phases. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the abdomen by reaching up into the mediastinum to divide the esophagus above the tumor. This is only feasible for tumors of the gastroesophageal junction. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided with a 60mm Medium-Thich (purple) endoGIA TriStaple stapler.</p>
<p>Division of Esophagus (Four-Phase)
Penrose Drain (Four-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the chest. In order to facilitate the thoracic dissection, a 1/4″ penrose drain is tied around the distal esophagus and the drain is slid cephalad into the mediastinum. The ‘tails’ of the drain are directed into the right chest so that they can be grasped from the right chest during the thoracic phase and can be used to provide traction on the esophagus in order to Entry into right chest The pneumoperitoneum in the abdomen is vented and the gas pressure turned down to 8mmHg in preparation for the thoracic phase. The bed is rotated to the left 20 degrees. A site for entry in to the left chest is selected just posterior to the tip of the scapula. An incision is made here and a 5mm optical port with a 5mm 0 degree scope used to enter the chest. The chest is insufflated at 8mmHg of carbon dioxide, which helps to both copllapase the lung and depress the diaphragm. Two 12mm ports are placed. The more superior is placed lateral and superior to the nipple. The inferior port is placed just lateral to the diaphragmatic reflection. It is ciritcal to avoid injury to the diaphragm (and liver) with the inferior port placement. A mini-thoracotomy incision is placed along the mid-axillary line, frequently in the same interspace as the inferior/anterior 12mm port. The chest is entered just superior to the rib and the intercostal muscles divided with the LigaSure device to allow the ribs to separate. A narrow Deaver retractor is used to guage the space between the ribs, as the width of the retractor approximates the diameter of the 25mm stapler. A 5mm ‘U’ port is generally placed as high as possible midway between the scapular tip port and the anterior/superior 12mm port t0o the 4 right 5</p>
<p>Division of Esophagus (Two-Phase)
In patients with low-lying tumors, it is possible to divide the esophagus above the tumor from the abdominal approach. This evaluation is facilitated by review of the properative endoscopy (and EUS), and the PET scan, particularly the PET obtained prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation.</p>
<p>After dissection of the mediastinum, a endoGIA stapler with a 60mm Medium-Thick (purple) load is inserted through a 12mm port either placed either through the GelPort or by upsizing the most lateral LUQ</p>
<p>Construction of Conduit
The distal esophagus and stomach is exteriorized through the GelPort. The lesser curvature vessels are divided with the LigaSure 7-9cm cephalad from the pylorus. The stomach is now placed on stretch along the greater curvature. An endoGIA Medium-Thick (purple) stapler is used to construct a 5-6cm wide gastric tube. In constructing the conduit in a patient with a tumor of the GE jnction invading into the cardia, it is important to be certain that the staple line to construct the conduit stays clear of the tumor. Patients with tumors invading the cardia are at risk of a positive distal margin, meaning that microscopic tumor may be left in the wall of the gastric conduit. To make things more complicated, in patients with low-lying esophageal or GE junction tumors, not all of the length of the conduit are needed in order to reach to the level of the esophageal transection. After construction of the anastomosis, the ‘extra’ cephalad portion of the conduit (near the angle of His) are excised as the ‘additional gastric margin.’ In order to distinguish which portions of the conduit staple line which will be used to replace the esophagus and those which will be included in the ‘additional gastric margin,’ both sides of the gastric conduit staple line are marked with sutures designated ‘A,’ ‘B,’ ‘C,’ etc proceeding from the Angle of His to the antrum.</p>
<p>The distal esophagus and GE junction are now sent for frozen section.</p>
<p>Feeding jejunostomy
The ligament of Trietz is identified and the jejunum is identified 20cm distal and marked with a directional suture. A site is selected to the left of the handport incision. A 16Fr Cook Introducer Kit is used to pass a 16Ga needle, followed by a J wire, through the left rectus muscle. A skin incision 4mm in length is made adjacent to the J wire. The 16Fr dilator and sheath are now passed through the rectus muscle and the dilator and wire removed. A 14Fr Jejunostomy Tube 0301-14 is selected and the ‘wings’ trimmed off with a scalpel. The jejunostomy tube is passed through the peelaway sheath, which is removed.</p>
<p>A pursestring suture 1.5cm in diameter is placed on the antimesenteric border of the jejunum. The pursestring is started and ends on the lateral aspect. A second 16Fr Cook Introduced Kit is used to introduce the J wire through the center of the pursestring.</p>
<p>Placement of Drains
Two (or three) 19Fr full-fluted Blake drains (72230) are placed:</p>
<p>JP1: placed into the left pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the most lateral 5mm port site on the LUQ
JP2: placed into the right pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the next most medial 5mm LUQ port site
JP3: (optional) placed in the abdomen posterior to the left lateral segment of the liver and brought out through the most medial 5mm LUQ port site
Transposition of Conduit
The gastric conduit is now placed into the right pleura through the mediastinum, with the assistance of a laparoscopic Babcock and gentle pressure on the greater curvature with the fingers.</p>
<p>Entrance into the R chest (Two Phase)
For two-phase operations, ports are now placed into the right chest, as stated above . In similar fashion, the inferior pulmonary ligament in dissected and the lung reflected anterior.</p>
<p>Anastomosis
The right chest is entered and the right lung reflected anterior with the paddle placed in the superior/anterior port. The gastric conduit is placed into the mediastinum by tucking it medially from the right pleura into the posterior mediastinum, in order to allow the conduit to take the most direct path from the hiatus to the proximal esophagus. Gentle superior tension is now applied to the conduit in order to eliminate redundancy. The paddle retractor is now moved from the anterior/inferior port to the anterior/superior 12mm port and the lung reflected anterior and inferior.</p>
<p>OrVil
The OrVil device is now used to place a EEA anvil into the distal esophagus. In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil.</p>
<p>The shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures.</p>
<p>The superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device. The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (‘sock over shoe’). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam.</p>
<p>The anastomosis is completed by firing a endoGIA Medium-Thick (purple) linear) across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is sent for pathologic exam as ‘additional gastric margin.’</p>
<p>NG Tube
A Covidien Salem Sump 18Fr nasogastric tube is passed by the anesthetist. A laparoscopic BK ultrasound is used to monitor the passage of the NG tube through the esophagus and into the gastric conduit. The NG tube is passed to the level that all for dots are outside the nose, with the 4th dot at the nares. The NG tube is secured with an AMT bridle.</p>
<p>Chest Tube
A 28Fr Blake chest tube is placed through the anterior/inferior 12mm port and is positioned into the posterior mediastinum. JP2 is placed near the gastric conduit. The right lung is re-inflated.</p>
<p>Closure
The stapler access port incision is closed with 0 Vicryl to approximate the serratus muscle. The incisions are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.</p>

<h1 number="21"><span class="header-section-number">21</span> Staging</h1>
<p>The staging workup begins once a diagnosis is made on endoscopy.</p>
<p>The first step is to make a preliminary determination whether the tumor is early stage (and can be treated with endoscopy or primary surgery) or later stage (and treated with chemoradiation followed by surgery or with)</p>
<p>The diagnostic studies needed for these treatment groups are different, so the workup can be make more efficient by sorting patients at presentation in to two groups:</p>
<p>Patients with minimal dysphagia, no weight loss, and tumors with less than 3cm cranio-caudal extent have a reasonable change of being T1 or T2 tumors. Tumors &lt;3cm in length are much more likely to represent T1-2 lesions than those <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> 3cm<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hollis1114" role="doc-biblioref">Hollis et al. 2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>Superficial and Localized tumors generally present with minimal dysphagia or weight loss. These tumors may present with bleeding, or dysphagia without weight loss. For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so <strong>endoscopic ultrasound</strong> is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Locally-advanced or metastatic tumors tend to present with dysphagia and weight loss. At first approximation, these tumors are usually clinical T3 lesions, and the important bifurcation in their treatment is the presence or absence of metastatic disease. For patients with dysphagia and weight loss, <strong>PET</strong> is the most frequent initial staging study after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Patients who present with dysphagia are likely to have T3 or T4 disease, which is generally treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering [Ripley 226] among 61 patients with esophageal cancer who presented with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors. On the other hand, among 53 patients without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery. Their conclusion was that EUS could be omitted from the workup of patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients without dysphagia.</p>
<p>PET can be helpful in evaluating patients who may have T1-2 disease, and might be candidates for primary surgical therapy. A comparison of PET and EUS [malik,claxton,1] showed that uT1-2 tumors had median metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of 6.7cm<sup>3</sup>, compared with uT3-4 tumors, with a median SUV of 35.7cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>The challenge for treatment decision-making is the limited sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound in ruling out pT3 or pN+ disease. In other words, if a patient who is thought to have cT2N0 disease undergoes resection, and is found on pathology to have pT3 or pN<sup>+</sup> disease, this would dictate the need for postoperative chemoradiation.
