## Rounds

Starting time for rounds is variable from day to day. Maddie Georgino will help organize work and timing of rounds, etc.

## Resident Epic teams:

- Colorectal Surgery Pineville

Residents will be assigned to Epic teams by schedule. It is critical that you notify service attendings before the start of the month to adjust the resident Epic schedule. Each “shift” is 5:50am to 6pm. At 6pm the resident Epic Teams will be forwarded to the night team.

Please append a text block to the bottom of each progress note specifying the Epic Team for that patient to facilitate communication from nursing.
