# Barrett's Esophagus

AGA recommendations for endoscopic ablation of Barretts:

Strong recommendation for ablation of high grade dysplasia. Recommends surveillance at 3,6,12 months, then annually. 

Shaheen randomized trial of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for dysplasia [@shaheen2277]. Mean age 66 years. Mean length of Barrett's esophagus 5.3cm. RFA resulted in 77% rate of eradication of Barrett's at one year.

Meta-abalysis suggests ablation can reduce rate of development of cancer from 6.6 per 100 person years to 1.9 [@rastogi394]

RFA for Barrett's national registry [@ganz35]

RFA for low-grade dysplasia [@phoa1209] resulted in 25% risk reduction in progression to HGD.
