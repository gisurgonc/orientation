Importance of total mesorectal excision was championed by Bill Heald [@heald1479] who emphasized sharp dissection of the mesorecum outside of the visceral fasial envelope.  In addition he advocated dissection of the totality of the mesorectum distal to the tumor to avoid leaving behind nodes within the mesorectum distal to the tumor[@quirke996] [@nagtegaal303] [@paty365].
