Among 823 patients, local recurrence was 6% in the preoperative group vs 13% in the postop group (p=0.0006). Overall survival was not different, but preop chemoradiation was less toxic. Pathologic complete response rate in the preoperative group as 8%. NSABP R-03 clinical trial (Roh et al. 2009) randomized 267 patients with T3 or T4 or node-positive rectal cancer to preop vs postop chemoradiation. Disease-free survival was better in the preoperative group, wiht no difference in overall survival. Pathologic complete response rate in the preop group was 15%. Dutch Rectal Cancer Trial (CKVO 95-04): Demostrated the benefit of preop radiation in combination with TME(Kapiteijn et al. 2001). Radiation reduced local recurrence form 10.9% to 5.6% 42.0.1 Short-course preoperative therapy Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial compared surgery alone with preoperative short-course therapy consisting of 500cGy of radiation without chemotherapy administered in one week prior to surgery. Local recurrence was 9% in the therapy group vs 26% in the control group, with an improvement in overall survival of 38% vs 80%(Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial et al. 1997). Of note, this trial was performed in the era prioro to the widespread use of total mesorectal excision. Stockholm III trial showed that short-course radiation therapy performed 4-8 weeks prior to surgery resulted in imporved rates of pathologic complete response (12% vs 2%) compared with short-course radiation therapy performed the week prior to surgery (Pettersson et al. 2015) The Dutch trial found a reduction in local recurrence form 10.9% to 5.6% with preoperative radiation with no difference in survival(Kapiteijn et al. 2001). A later update[(575?);21596621 ] The Medical Research Council C07 trial compared preoperative short-course radiation with selective post-operative chemoradiation and found no difference in local recurrence (4.4% vs 10.6%) and no difference in overall survival.(Sebag-Montefiore et al. 2009) 42.0.2 Total Neoadjuvant therapy RAPIDO trial randomized 920 patients with T4 or node-positive disease to long-course chemoradiation followed by surgery vs short-course radiation followed by chemotherapy and surgery. The pCR rate was significantly higher in the short course/chemotherapy/surgery group (28% vs 14%) and disease-specific surival at 3years was higher (30% vs 24%).(Bahadoer et al. 2021) (van der Valk et al. 2020) PRODIGE 23 randomized 461 patients with T3 or T4 recta cancers to long-course radiation followed by surgery vs induction chemotherapy, long-course radiation followed by surgery. Up-front chemotherapy was associates with increased 3-year survival (76% vs 69%) and an increase in rate of pathologic complete response of 28% vs 12%.(Conroy et al. 2021) STELLAR trial (Jin et al. 2022) TNT with short-course radiation (5Gy x 5 days) + CAPEOX chemotherapy vs long-course chemoRT with capecitibine. No differences in relapse-free survival or metastasis free survival. Overall survival better with TNT (p=0.03). On subgroup analysis, no group appeared to have more benefit. pCR rate 17% with TNT vs 13.9% with conventional chemoradiation. Positive margins (R1) occurred in 8.5% of TNT patients vs 12.5% in the conventional chemoRT group. OPRA clinical trial (Garcia-Aguilar et al. 2022). 324 rectal cancer patients staged with MRI randomized to INCT (induction chemo followed by chemoRT) vs CNCT (Chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy). Patients with a resopnse were offered watch and wait. Patients without a response were treated with surgery. No difference in disease-free survival or overall survival. Among patients in watch and wait, somewhat more patients with INCT had recurrences (42 patients vs 32 patients). More organ preservation with CNCT. See also (Smith et al. 2015) 42.1 Non-operative management of Rectal Cancer MSKCC published an experience of 113 patients with cCR after chemoradiation for rectal cancer who elected non-operative management (smith184896?). Among this group, 22 developped a local recurrence, and 8% developed metastatic disease.(Smith, Paty, and Garcia-Aguilar 2020) References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
