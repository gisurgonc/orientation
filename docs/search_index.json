Feedings are generally begun as continuous (around-the-clock) and are then transitioned to nocturnal (generally 6pm to 10am) prior to discharge. Jejunostomy feedings carry a small but significant risk (~1%) of small bowel necrosis, as evidenced by the findings of pneumatosis on CT scan and in some cases small bowel necrosis and perforation. The existing literature would suggest that the early symptoms associated with small bowel necrosis are abdominal distension. As a result, patients on jejunostomy tube feeding need to be carefully monitored for distension, and tube feeds held if distension develops.1 Tube feeds are generally started at 30mL/hour in the immediate postoperative patients. In patients who are awake and in whom it is possible to determine whether or not there are issues of tube feed intolerance, the rate of tube feedings is increased 10mL/hour every 8 hours to a goal of 60mL/hour. In patients who are intubated/sedated, the advancement of tube feeds is individualized, and decisions are made on a daily basis on rounds. Choice of Tube Feed Formula Options for formulas for jejunostomy feedings: Osmolite 1.5: First-line formula for BMI &lt;35 Intact protein 14.8 grams Carbohydrates 48.2 grams Fat 11.6 grams Vital 1.5: Second-line formula (intolerant of Osmolite) for BMI&lt;35 Peptide protein 16 grams Carbohydrates 44.2 grams Fat 13.5 grams Vivonex: Third-line formula (intolerant of Vital) or for ultra-low fat diet (eg chylous leak) Amino Acids 12.5 grams Carbohydrates 44 grams Fat 2.9 grams Promote: First-line formula for BMI &gt;35 or diabetics Peptide protein 14.8 grams Carbohydrates 30.8 grams Fat 16.2 grams Vital High Protein: Second-line formula for BMI &gt;35 Peptide protein 20.7 grams Carbohydrates 26.7 grams Fat 5.5 grams For patients who receive tube feedings preoperatively, the same formula is generally used after surgery. For patients with BMI less than 35, Osmolite 1.5 is used as a starting formula. If Osmolite is not tolerated due to diarrhea, Vital 1.5 can be used. For patients with BMI greater than 35, Promote is used as a starting formula, as it contains a lower amount of carbohydrates then Osmolite 1.5. Patients who are intolerant to Promote can be switched to Vital High Protein. Patients less than 150 pounds receive 4 cans of tube feedings, administered at 60mL/hour x 16 hours (6pm to 10am). Patients greater than 150 pounds receive 5 cans of tube feedings, administered at 75mL/hour x 16 hours (6pm to 10am). Patients with BMI &gt;35 receive 5 cans of Promote (or Vital High Protein). Glucerna is formulated with carbohydrates with low glycemic index, which is particularly helpful for bolus feeding (via gastrostomy) or patients who are eating. Glycemic index is less important in patients on continuous tube feeds (eg via jejunostomy). In addition, the high fiber context of Glucerna may make this formula more prone to causing clogging of jejunostomy tubes. Free Water Flushes Once patients are transferred to the ward, free water via jejunostomy should be ordered as 240mL via jejunostomy qid. This is entered under Flush Enteral Tube for Free Water Requirements. Diarrhea with Jejunostomy Feedings Patients who experience diarrhea during jejunostomy administration (especially diarrhea at night) will need this addressed. Several steps - Send stool for C Diff - Consider changing tube feedings to a more easily digestible formula. Patients on Osmolite 1.5 can be changed to Vital 1.5. Patients on Vital 1.5 can be changed to Vivonex. Patients on Promote can be changed to Vital High Protein - Stop tube feedings for 2-4 hours to allow diarrhea to resolve - restart tube feeds at a lower rate (eg 20mL/hour lower than the prior rate). - Bannatrol can be given to patients taking an oral diet. Bannatrol is NOT given via jejunostomy tube to avoid clogging. - Lomotil is generally used as a last resort. 14.1 Weaning Tube Feeds As patients increase their oral intake as outpatients, tube feeds are gradually weaned. Patients on 5 cartons/day (75mL/hour x 16 hours) can be reduced to 4 cartons/day (60mL/hour x 16 hours) with a 20% reduction of insulin at initiation of tube feeds and 6 hours later. Patients on 4 cartons/day (60mL/hour x 16 hours) can be reduced to 3 cartons/day (60mL/hour x 12 hours) while continuing the same insulin dose at the initiation of tube feeds and omitting the insulin dose 6 hours later. Patients taking 3 cartons/day are weaned by changing to every other day administration of tube feeds (and insulin). On evening when tube feeds are not given, insulin is not administered. 14.2 Med Administration via J-Tubes Patients who have difficulty with dysphagia or complete esophageal obstruction will need to have their medicines administered via jejunostomy tube. The process of designing a medicine regimen which can safely be administered via enteral tube can be a challenge and may require a consultation with the hospital pharmacist. One the other hand, the financial consequences of a clogged feeding tube are substantial. Flomax is never given via jejunostomy tubes due to risk of clogging. Several common medicines are available in liquid form: Acetaminophen (pediatric formulation) Gabapentin Oxycodone Hydrocodone + acetaminophen 14.3 Occluded Jejunostomy Tubes Jejunostomy tubes which are refractory to the usual non-invasive means (warm water, Coca-Cola) will need to be changed over a wire in Interventional Radiology. 14.4 Jejunostomy + Diabetes Inpt  Jejunostomy ~ Diabetes Patients on tube feeds are typically started on continuous (around-the-clock) tube feedings, and subsequently changed to a nocturnal regimen (typically 6pm to 10am). The diabetic management for these patients differs depending upon their tube feeding regimen: Diabetics on Continuous Tube Feeds. Non-insulin diabetic patients are generally initially given Osmolite 1.5 as it provides higher caloric density and does not contain fiber, which tends to clog the feeding tubes. Diabetic patients requiring insulin can be initially trialed on Osmolite 1.5 but are changed to Promote or Glucerna 1.5 if their blood sugars prove difficult to control (as evidence by either the need for EndoTool or requiring a q6 hour regimen of insulin N + insulin R). Diabetic patients who need insulin while receiving tube feedings are typically treated initially with continuous tube feedings and around-the-clock insulin. Patients with large insulin requirements may need hourly intravenous insulin (with dosages calculated via EndoTool). Once their insulin requirements are stabilized, they are transitioned to a q6 hour regimen consisting of N and R insulin, typically twice as many units of N insulin as R (for instance, 6Units of N + 3 Units of R insulin every six hours). Patients who require EndoTool or a q6hr regimen need an endocrinology consultation with Dr Kelli Dunn to assist in diabetic management. Diabetics on Nocturnal Tube Feeds Most patients are transitioned from continuous tube feeds to nocturnal prior to discharge. Diabetic patients on nocturnal tube feedings typically receive tube feeding from 6pm to 10am and receive insulin at initiation of tube feeds (6pm) and again at 6 hours later (midnight). A typical regimen might be 18U of 70/30 at 1800 and 18U of 70/30 at MN. An alternative might be 12U NPH + 6U Regular at 1800 and 16U NPH and 8U Regular insulin at MN. Because it can take several days to determine the correct insulin regimen, diabetic patients receiving jejunostomy feedings are cycled as early in their hospital course as possible to avoid delaying discharge for blood sugar management. Diabetic patients receiving insulin will need careful coordination of tube feeding and insulin administration when they are being transitioned from continuous to nocturnal tube feeds. Patients on continuous tube feeds may receive insulin on a q6 hour schedule, while those receiving nocturnal tube feeds receive insulin at 1800 and MN. When patients on continuous tube feeds are transitioned, the tube feeds are stopped at 10am, to be restarted at 6pm that evening. It is critical that as soon as the tube feeds are stopped at 10am, that the q6 hour insulin as stopped as well. In either case it is critical that if tube feedings are stopped, standing insulin administration (either q6 hour OR 1800 and MN) be stopped as well. In these cases, sliding scale insulin is generally continued. Day Time Tube Feeds Insulin SUN MN 60mL/hr 8N+4R Mon 6am 60mL/hr 8N+R Mon Noon Stop None Mon 6pm 75mL/hr 16N + 8R Mon MN 75mL/hr 16N+ 8R Tues 10am Stop None Tues 6pm 75mL/hr 16N+ 8R Tues MN 75mL/hr 16N+ 8R Weds 10am Stop None In this example, the patient was receiving 8N + 4R every 6 hours, so total insulin units per day is (8+4) x 4 = 48units. Because the carbohydrate load of 60mL/hour x 24 is roughly equivalent to 75mL/hour x 16 hours, the total insulin administered is roughly the same. When converted to nocturnal dosing, the patient now received 16+8 = 24 units twice (6pm and MN) = 48U. In practice, it may be wiser to begin by adjusting the dose down a little, to perhaps 14U N and 7U R for the first night.
