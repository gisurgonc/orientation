# Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma

[NCCN Guidelines](https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/anal_blocks.pdf)

Surgical Clinics Review Article: [@young629]

## Chemoradiation

Chemoradiation is now the standard for anal squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal and for perianal cancers (except for small T1 lesions). Nigro protocol is the standard approach.[@nigro1826]

### Restaging after chemoRT

Based on the results of the ACT-II study, it may be appropriate to follow patients who have not achieved a complete clinical response with persistent anal cancer up to 6 months following completion of radiation therapy and chemotherapy as long as there is no evidence of progressive disease during this period of follow-up. Persistent disease may continue to regress even at 26 weeks from the start of treatment.[@james516]
