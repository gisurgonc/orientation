# Rectal Adjuvant Therapy

## Surgery $\Rightarrow$ CRT

The original approach to adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer was surgery followed by chemoradiation.

## CRT $\Rightarrow$ Surgery

The next innovation to adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer was chemoradiation prior to surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.

German Rectal Cancer Study (AIO-94) compared preop and postop chemoradiation in locally-advanced rectal cancer [@sauer173]. Among 823 patients, local recurrence was 6% in the preoperative group vs 13% in the postop group (p=0.0006). Overall survival was not different, but preop chemoradiation was less toxic. Pathologic complete response rate in the preoperative group as 8%.

NSABP R-03 clinical trial [@roh5124] randomized 267 patients with T3 or T4 or node-positive rectal cancer to preop vs postop chemoradiation. Disease-free survival was better in the preoperative group, wiht no difference in overall survival. Pathologic complete response rate in the preop group was 15%. The trial did not meets its accrual targets.

Dutch Rectal Cancer Trial (CKVO 95-04): Demonstrated the benefit of preop radiation in combination with TME[@kapiteijn638]. Radiation reduced local recurrence form 10.9% to 5.6%

The Dutch trial found a reduction in local recurrence form 10.9% to 5.6% with preoperative radiation with no difference in survival[@kapiteijn638]. A later update[@vangijn575] 

The Medical Research Council C07 trial compared preoperative short-course radiation with selective post-operative chemoradiation and found no difference in local recurrence (4.4% vs 10.6%) and no difference in overall survival.[@sebag-montefiore811]

## Short-course RT

An alternative to preoperative chemoradiation over 6 weeks is to administer radiation alone properative over a five day period.

Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial compared surgery alone with preoperative short-course therapy consisting of 5 doses of 500cGy of radiation without chemotherapy administered in one week prior to surgery. Local recurrence was 9% in the therapy group vs 26% in the control group, with an improvement in overall survival of 38% vs 80%[@swedishrectalcancertrial980]. Of note, this trial was performed in the era prioro to the widespread use of total mesorectal excision.

Stockholm III trial showed that short-course radiation therapy performed 4-8 weeks prior to surgery resulted in imporved rates of pathologic complete response (12% vs 2%) compared with short-course radiation therapy performed the week prior to surgery [@pettersson972]

## Total Neoadjuvant

A more modern approach has been to administer chemotherapy in addition to chemoradiation prior to surgery, Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT)

RAPIDO trial randomized 920 patients with T4 or node-positive disease to long-course chemoradiation followed by surgery  vs short-course radiation followed by chemotherapy and surgery. The pCR rate was significantly higher in the short course/chemotherapy/surgery group (28% vs 14%) and disease-specific surival at 3years was higher (30% vs 24%).[@bahadoer29]  [@vandervalk75]

PRODIGE 23 randomized 461 patients with T3 or T4 recta cancers to long-course radiation followed by surgery vs induction chemotherapy, long-course radiation followed by surgery. Up-front chemotherapy was associates with increased 3-year survival (76% vs 69%) and an increase in rate of pathologic complete response of 28% vs 12%.[@conroy702]

STELLAR trial [@jin1681] TNT with short-course radiation (5Gy x 5 days) + CAPEOX chemotherapy vs long-course chemoRT with capecitibine.  No differences in relapse-free survival or metastasis free survival. Overall survival better with TNT (p=0.03). On subgroup analysis, no group appeared to have more benefit. pCR rate 17% with TNT vs 13.9% with conventional chemoradiation. Positive margins (R1) occurred in 8.5% of TNT patients vs 12.5% in the conventional chemoRT group.

OPRA clinical trial [@garcia-aguilar2546]. 324 rectal cancer patients staged with MRI randomized to INCT (induction chemo followed by chemoRT) vs CNCT (Chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy). Patients with a response were offered watch and wait. Patients without a response were treated with surgery. No difference in disease-free survival or overall survival or metastasis-free survival. 304 patients were restaged and only 26% were recommended to have surgery. Among 225 patients in watch and wait, somewhat more patients with INCT had recurrences (40% of 105 = 42 patients vs 27% of 102 =32 patients). More organ preservation at 3 years with CNCT (60% CNCT vs 47% INCT).See also [@smith767]

## Selective Adjuvant

Selective adjuvant therapy approaches reserves adjuvant therapy for high-risk patients, and treats low-risk patients with surgery alone.

MERCURY study group has examined selective approaches to adjuvant chemoradiation in low-risk patients with rectal cancer. [@taylor711], [@strassburg2790]

## Neoadjuvant ImmunoTx

Mismatch repair protein deficient (MSI-high) colorectal cancer (due to either Lynch Syndrome or BRAF-1 mutation) responds pooly to chemotherapy but responds well to immunotherapy with PD-L1 blockade

MSKCC trial of neoadjuvant PD-L1 blockade with 6 months of dostarlimab for 12 patients with MMR-deficient (MSI-high) rectal cancer resulted in 100% clinical response rate [@cercek2363]. No patients were subsequently treated with either chemoradiation or surgery as originally planned.

PICC trial [@hu38] Chinese trial of PD-L1 blockade with neoadjvant toripalimab + colecoxib vs toripalimab for 3 months in 34 patients with MMR-deficient locally-advanced (T3/4 or N+) colorectal cancer. All patients were then treated with surgery.   Pathologic complete response in 88% of dual-therapy patients and 65% of monotherapy. Grade 3 toxicity in 1/34 patients. Previous neoadjuvant chemo in 25%. Rectal cancer in 18%.

NICHE trial [@chalabi1949] 115 patients with dMMR locally-advanced colon cancer treated with a neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Pathologic complete response in 68%. No recurrences with a median followo up of 26 months. 


# Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy

The PROSPECT clinical trial [@schrag322] randomized patients with T2/3 recctal cancer to neoadjuvant therapy with chemoradiation vs FOLFOX.  585 in the FOLFOX group and 543 in the chemoradiotherapy group. FOLFOX was noninferior to chemoradiotherapy for disease-free survival and the groups were similar with respect to overall survival. In the FOLFOX group, 53 patients (9.1%) received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (if the primary tumor decreased in size by <20% or if FOLFOX was discontinued because of side effects) and 8 (1.4%) received postoperative chemoradiotherapy.
