# CMC Inpatient

Colorectal Surgery (Davis/Kasten) and GI Surgical Oncology (Hill/Salo/Squires) will cover Pineville and CMC. For efficiency, the services at each hospital will merge for patient care. Each patient will continue to have an attending surgeon, but rounding and inpatient care will be provided by the service.

## Admissions

Provider group: “GI Surg Onc Attending LCI CMC”

List Attending Surgeon in addition

Patient List is CMC GI Surgical Oncology

## Rounds

Work rounds for both services (CR and SurgOnc) start at 6am in STICU or 11T.  Service attendings will be updated after rounds. 

## Resident Epic teams:

- GI Surgical Oncology Colorectal LCI CMC
- Colorectal Surgery Pineville

It is critical that you notify service attendings before the start of the month to adjust the resident call schedule. Each “shift” is 5:50am to 6pm. At 6pm the resident Epic Teams will be forwarded to the night team.

Please append a text block to the bottom of each progress note specifying the Epic Team *GI Surgical Oncology Colorectal LCI CMC* for that patient to facilitate communication from nursing.


## Consults

Established patients and directed should be discussed with the attending surgeon.

All new inpatient, PCL, and ER consults will be evaluated by the Red Team instead of the surgical oncology team. Established patients will be directed to either the Red Team or surgical oncology team depending on the time since surgery. Those within the three-month global period after surgery will continue to be evaluated by the surgical oncology team, while patients outside of the 90-day global period will be managed by the Red Team. This change aims to streamline patient care. All established patients will be listed on the surgical oncology list, though residents will not be responsible for management if the Red Team is primary.
