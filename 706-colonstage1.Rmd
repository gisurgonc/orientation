## Immunotherapy for dMMR (MSI high)

Colorectal cancers deficient in mismatch-repair proteins (dMMR) respond poorly to 5FU-based chemotherapy but do respond to immune-checkpoint inhibitors ($\alpha$-PD-1, ($\alpha$PD-L1, ($\alpha$-CTLA-4).

[Review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.795972/full) of immune checkpoint inhibitors in colorectal cancer

Blockade of the PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) ligand with monoclonal antibody as shows efficacy in colorectal cancer, especially those deficient in mismatch repair protein expression, as manifested by microsatellite instability (MSI-High) on pathologic exam.
