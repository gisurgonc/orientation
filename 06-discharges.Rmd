**Discharge Prescriptions**

Prescriptions should be ideally be prepared the day prior to anticipated discharge and sent to the patient's pharmacy. According to [North Carolina STOP guidelines](https://www.ncmedboard.org/images/uploads/license_applications/STOPAct-focusedFAQs-Sept2019.pdf), opioid prescriptions for postoperative patients should be for no more than a 7 day supply. At the same time, patients taking narcotics in the hospital should have the same dosages for their outpatient prescription, to avoid patients running out of narcotics between the time of discharge and their first clinic visit.

Note that metoprolol is available in liquid form in the hospital, but is not available for outpatient prescription


**Additional Appointments**

If followup appointments in additional to surgical followup are needed, these should be designated on the discharge orders. Particularly:

- Primary Care Physician
- Cardiologist (if new cardiac medicines)
- Co-surgeons (Urology, Thoracic Surgery, GYN)

**Discharge Summary**

The discharge summary documents important events and complications in the postoperative course and serves to inform the referring physician and primary physician about these events, but also serves as a blueprint for post-discharge treatment planning. Please recognize that the first post-operative visit may be with a resident who may be meeting the patient for the first time. Key items to include:
